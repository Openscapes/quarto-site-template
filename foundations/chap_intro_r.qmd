## Introduction to R and RStudio

### What is R?

```{r}
#| label: r-logo
#| column: margin
#| message: false
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images', "Rlogo.JPG"))

```


-   Open source (free!) statistical programming language/software

-   It can be used for:

    -   Working with data - cleaning, wrangling and transforming
    -   Conducting analyses including advanced statistical methods
    -   Creating high-quality tables & figures
    -   Communicate research with R Markdown

-   It is constantly growing!

-   Has a strong online support community

-   Since it's one programming language, it is versatile enough to take you from raw data to publishable research using free, reproducible code!

### What is RStudio?

```{r}
#| label: rstudio-logo
#| column: margin
#| message: false
#| out-width: 100%
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images', "RStudiologo.png"))

```


RStudio is a free, open source IDE (integrated development environment) for R. (You must install R before you can install RStudio.) Its interface is organized so that the user can clearly view graphs, tables, R code, and output all at the same time. It also offers an Import-Wizard-like feature that allows users to import CSV, Excel, SPSS (\*.sav), and Stata (\*.dta) files into R without having to write the code to do so.

### R versus Others Softwares

Excel and SPSS are convenient for data entry, and for quickly manipulating rows and columns prior to statistical analysis. However, they are a poor choice for statistical analysis beyond the simplest descriptive statistics, or for more than a very few columns.

### Why should you learn R

-   R is becoming the "*lingua franca*" of data science
-   Most widely used and it is rising in popularity
-   R is also the tool of choice for data scientists at Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon
-   R's popularity in academia is important because that creates a pool of talent that feeds industry.
-   Learning the "skills of data science" is easiest in R

Some of the reasons for chosing R over others are are:

- Missing values are handled inconsistently, and sometimes incorrectly.
- Data organisation difficult.
- Analyses can only be done on one column at a time.
- Output is poorly organised.
- No record of how an analysis was accomplished.
- Some advanced analyses are impossible


```{r}
#| label: fig-r-nature
#| fig-cap: "Increasing use of R in scientific research"
#| cap-location: margin
#| out-width: 80%
#| echo: false


knitr::include_graphics(here::here('images', "r_nature.JPG"))

```

### Advantages of using R/RStudio for research

- It is free and open-source
- It is designed to make it easy to write and reuse code
- Makes it convenient to view and interact with the objects stored in your environment
- Makes it easy to set your working directory and access files on your computer
- Integrates with collaboration and publishing tools

### Project Management and Workflows

The ability to integrate code and narratives is a major advantage of Quarto and the RStudio environment, especially considering the scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and eventually, everything ends up a bit mixed together. 

Quarto is a powerful tool that can't be fully utilized unless your project documents, scripts and other files are well-organized. So, letâ€™s take a look at RStudio's features for managing projects and discuss some of the best practices when working with data.

#### Advantages of using RStudio for your research project

RStudio is the perfect tool for a reproducible research project. With a good project layout, you can make your life much easier:

- It will help ensure the integrity of your data
- It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else (a colleague, mentor, collaborator, etc.)
- It allows you to upload your code with your manuscript submission easily.
- It makes picking the project back up after a break easier.
- It makes your research reproducible!

### Let's give it a try!

1. Create a project in RStudio.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint!

You can create a new project in RStudio:
1. Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
2. Click "New Directory".
3. Click "New Project".
4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. `my_first_project`[^1]. 
5. Click the "Create Project" button.

Note that there are is a `*.RProj` file created in the project folder.
:::

[^1]: Keep a note of the location of the directory on your computer.

2. Open an RStudio project through the file system

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint!

1. Exit RStudio.
2. Navigate to the directory where you created the project.
3. Double click on the `.Rproj` file in that directory.
