## Principles of Reproducible Research

### What is Reproducible Research

Research is considered to be reproducible when the exact results can be reproduced if given access to the original data, software, or code.

-   The same results should be obtained under the same conditions
-   It should be possible to recreate the same conditions

#### Definition

> Reproducibility refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator. That is, a second researcher might use the same raw data to build the same analysis files and implement the same statistical analysis in an attempt to yield the same results. Reproducibility is a minimum necessary condition for a finding to be believable and informative.

#### Elements of Reproducible Research

There are four key elements of reproducible research:

-   data documentation
-   data publication
-   code publication
-   output publication

## Reproducibility Crisis

```

#### Factors Contributing to the Reproducibility Crisis

-   Not enough documentation on how experiment is conducted and data is generated
-   Data used to generate original results unavailable
-   Software used to generate original results unavailable
-   Difficult to recreate software environment (libraries, versions) used to generate original results
-   Difficult to rerun the computational steps



While reproducibility is the minimum requirement and can be solved with "good enough" computational practices, replicability/ robustness/ generalisability of scientific findings are an even greater concern involving research misconduct, questionable research practices (p-hacking, HARKing, cherry-picking), sloppy methods, and other conscious and unconscious biases.
